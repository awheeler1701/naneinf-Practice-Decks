## Features
### Custom practice decks
Adds decks that use the Plasma Deck scoring & scaling, but filter out as many jokers, consumables, tags, & vouchers as possible, to make unseeded naneinf runs much easier to obtain (mostly meant for practicing White Stake Plasma Deck unseeded naneinf runs).

For the basis behind what was banned (and why) from each deck, please consult the wonderful tutorial for unseeded legendary-less naneinf runs by the lovely Dr. Spectred (Balatro University):
